Are your instructions consistent in use of language and tone?
    I believe, at least with what I have now, I am staying consistant with my tone and the use of langauge, however I need to continue to make sure I stay consistant.

What are some adjectives you would use to describe your set of instructions? What sort of consistency and "branding" are you attempting to create in the word choice and language you're using?
    Some adjetives I would use would be "Informative, simple, and basic" as that is my goal for this set of instructions, it gives sufficent information to understand what you are doing, yet easy enough for anyone to do it 

 What is the tone, anyway?
    

What kind of vibe would illustrations in your particular set of instructions need to look like?
    I don't quite know what vibe means here, however the visuals are there to try to explain what each menu is showing and what steps to take when more complex matters come up.

How would you simplify the visuals?
    The most basic method that comes to mind is cropping large screens and only showing what is immeditely being talked about/needed, then showing/hiding whatever else as applicable.

How would you assign colors, and why would you choose those colors? Do you currently have a color scheme?
    I would say the current colour scheme would be red for things that are important notes for the reader, perhaps a blue for headers, and then just normal black for the rest/default colouring.
