	The purpose of our usability study is to provide feedback to
the developers of the center of disease control's website to make it more
accessable and improve their reach to assist in their goal of widespread
medical knowledge for the latest devleopments. 

Completed Objectives>
	-Establish what to be examined on the website
	-Began drafting the paper
	-Established Communications
	-Developed a proper list to test/evaluate by

Agenda>
	-Continue working on paper
	-Ideally final draft to review before submission by the 3rd
	-Final meeting on/before 4th prior to submission

Challenges>
	Getting communications established is quite difficult when people do
not reguarly check the one forme of communication initially established, we
have since switched from Email communications to Discord

Conclusion>
	We are on track for success, we just need to dilligently work towards
completion. Establishing proper communication was a bit difficult, however it
appears that we are now on the same page, so it should be less of a worry.
